# Prompts to generate minimalists background 

## Dark theme
Create a minimalist flat background in 1024x1024 resolution.
The background must be a very dark muted color (such as soft black or very dark gray).
Use one of the following colors as the main palette base:
- #00B0FF (Light Blue)
- #304FFE (Deep Blue)
- #8E24AA (Vibrant Purple)
Create 2 to 6 smooth, flowing shapes across the composition, randomly combining:
- Curved geometric shapes such as ovals, blobs, rounded polygons, amorphous soft forms,
- And flowing organic waves.
Shapes must use only slight variations (maximum 20% brightness change) of the selected main color — no external or unrelated colors.
Shapes must vary noticeably in size, curvature, and position, creating a free, dynamic, and natural irregular layout.
Additionally, randomly distribute 8 to 20 small four-pointed stars across the background.
The stars must be subtle, minimal, and created using a slightly lighter variation of the main color (maximum 20% lighter).
No text, no symbols (other than the four-pointed stars), no dotted patterns, no gradients, no shadows, no textures, no 3D effects — only pure flat solid colors.
The design must feel extremely clean, spacious, modern, cosmic, artistic, and vibrant while preserving excellent readability for white text over the background.


## Light theme
Create a minimalist flat background in 1024x1024 resolution.
The background must be a very light muted color derived directly from the selected main color (without introducing external whites, creams, or grays).
Use one of the following colors as the main palette base:
- #F7E400 (Bright Yellow)
- #FF7043 (Soft Orange)
- #f9daa9 (Pastel Peach)
- #95a5a6 (Muted Gray)
- #f1c40f (Bright Yellow variant)
- #e74c3c (Bright Red)
- #9b59b6 (Vibrant Purple)
